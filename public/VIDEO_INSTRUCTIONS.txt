To add a background video to your homepage:

1. Place your video file in this 'public' folder
2. Name it 'background-video.mp4' (or update the filename in app/page.tsx)
3. For best results, use a video that:
   - Is under 10MB for fast loading
   - Has a 16:9 aspect ratio
   - Loops seamlessly
   - Doesn't have audio (it will be muted anyway)

The video will automatically play, loop, and have a white overlay for text readability.

To use the animated shapes instead of video:
- Comment out the video section in app/page.tsx
- Uncomment the animated shapes section
